Advent of Code 2024 in Julia
---

Attempting to learn Julia through Advent of Code. Each file will have a part1 and part2 per day with my original version, plus a part1_cleaned and part2_cleaned that will use more Julia-like idioms that might help clean up the code to make it more concise while staying readable (not necessarily more maintainable, just making more use of Julia's features).
